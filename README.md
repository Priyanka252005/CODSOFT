Overview

This repository contains three different Java programs designed for learning and practical implementation of programming concepts. Each program serves a specific purpose, ranging from number guessing, grade calculation, and basic ATM operations. Below is a detailed description of each program.

Program 1: Number Guessing Game

Description

This program generates random numbers between 0 and 99 and prompts the user to guess the number. It provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

How It Works

The program prompts the user to input a number.
A random number is generated.
If the user's number is lower or higher than the random number, a respective hint is given.
The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number.

Execution Steps

Compile and run the program.
Input a number when prompted.
Keep guessing until the program outputs "Correct."


Program 2: Grade Calculator


Description

This program calculates the total marks, average percentage, and grade of a student based on their scores in five subjects.

How It Works

The user inputs marks for Tamil, English, Maths, Science, and Social Science.

The program calculates:

Total marks.
Average percentage.
Grade based on the average percentage.
The output displays total marks, average percentage, and the corresponding grade.
Grading Scale

91-100%	O
81-90%	A+
71-80%	A
61-70%	B+
51-60%	B
46-50%	C
0-45%	Fail


Program 3: ATM Simulation

Description

This program simulates basic ATM functionalities such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry for a user.

Features

Deposit: Add money to the user's account.
Withdraw: Subtract money from the user's account, ensuring sufficient funds.
Check Balance: Display the user's account balance.
Exit: Exit the program.
Classes Used
ATM: Manages ATM operations like loading and withdrawing money.
User: Manages user-specific operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance checks.
How It Works
The user inputs their account number and name.
A menu is displayed with tasks:
Task 1: Deposit money.
Task 2: Withdraw money.
Task 3: Check balance.
Task 4: Exit the program.

Based on the selected task, the program performs the corresponding operation.
